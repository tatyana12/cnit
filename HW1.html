<h1>A progressive web app (PWA)</h1>
<p>This page will demonstrate a basic service worker and the option to install the application</p>
<h3>Demo with images</h3>
<p>A progressive web app (PWA) is the set of mobile web application development techniques that entails building apps that feel and look like native ones. Using a web stack (JS, HTML, and CSS), progressive web apps combine a rich functionality and smooth user experience associated with native apps. Simply put, PWA is the web app with the native-app flavor: After the installation, a user clicks on its icon on a device home screen and gets straight to the website.</p>
<p>Main characteristics of a PWA (Progressive Web Application) as following:
Full responsiveness and browser compatibility(PWAs work with all browsers and are compatible with any device, regardless of screen size and other specifications).
Connectivity independence. Progressive web applications can work both offline and on low-quality networks.
App-like interface. These apps mimic navigation and interactions of native apps.
 Push notifications. If used as a part of a good messaging strategy, push notifications can keep customers interested, motivating them to open and use an app more. 
Self-updates. Able to update themselves automatically, apps stay fresh.
Safety. These apps are served through HTTPS, so unauthorized users can’t access their content.
Discoverability and easy installation. While search engines classify PWAs as applications, they are not distributed via app stores. These apps can be shared through a URL instead so they’re easily found. The installation is simple and entails visiting a site and adding it to a device home screen.
